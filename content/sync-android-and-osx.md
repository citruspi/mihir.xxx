I got my first Android device, a Motorola Atrix 4G, one to one-and-a-half years ago. At that point, my iTunes library looked something like this:

| Media Type | Amount (GB) |
|:-|:-|
| Music | < 2 |
| Movies | > 20 |
| TV Shows | > 40 |

For the most part, my movies and tv shows were purchased from iTunes, but my music was not. So, if I was going to split my media between my Android (48 GB) and iPod (64 GB), it made sense to put the music on the former and the video on the latter.

I set out to find a solution which would __simply sync music from iTunes to my phone__.


Up to that point, my music collection, if you could call it that - it was less than 1 GB, was managed by iTunes on my Macbook and played back on my iPod Touch.
