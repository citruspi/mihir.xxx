Design Pattern
================


The design pattern of Felix Felicis contains one significant principle:

    Don't create anything.

That means we didn't (and will not) add any invalid markup like Jekyll
and others do. Everything should be valid in its markup language.

And hence there will be no plugin or extension like::

    {% gist id %}


Just like the zen of Python:

    Beautiful is better than ugly.

    Nothing is better than everything.
