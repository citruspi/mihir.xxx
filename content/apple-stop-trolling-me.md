Dear Apple,

Don't laugh when I call myself a fanboy and then say that I have an __iPod Touch 3G__ running __iOS 5.1.1__. Yeah, its terrible for my image as a fanboy, and yeah, its terrible for developing on iOS.

But, my point is that you are trolling me. __And, I don't like it.__

This is what is posted on the [iOS 6 page](http://apple.com/ios/whats-new) on your site:

iOS 6 doesn't support my device. That's fine. I get it, you have to move on. 

When my friends complain about this, I'm the first to defend you. You're not going to handicap your mobile OS just to support legacy hardware[^1]. And, you shouldn't.

When I get an iPhone when my contract expires, I'm going to love that you look forward.

But, I'm not loving that you troll me. You give me false hope.

You see, you list apps which __require iOS 6__ as being __compatible with the iPod Touch 3G__.

So, there are sad times when I open an app's page in the App Store on my iPod, touch the <span class="label label-success">BUY APP</span> button, and am told to update my device.

For example, last night I set out on a search for an [app.net](http://app.net) client for my iPod Touch.

The two apps which I've heard a lot about are [Felix]() and [Riposte]().

When I went to purchase each, I was confronted with:

Oh Apple, why would you do this? 

iOS 6 __requires__ iPod Touch 4+.  Felix for App.net __requires__ iOS 6. Ergo, Felix for App.net __is not compatible__ with iPod Touch 3G.

Yet, you list Felix for App.net as available for my iPod Touch 3G.

Even worse is that you're asking me to do something impossible - upgrade my iPod Touch to a firmware (iOS 6 for iPod Touch 3G) which does not exist. If it did, I would love it. But, it doesn't.

Every time that I set out to purchase an app that I've heard about, and it tells me to update to iOS 6, it breaks my heart.

Please fix this. The same way that apps that require a camera aren't available on the App Store on an iPod Touch 3G, neither should apps requiring iOS 6.

_Sincerely,_

Mihir Singh

__Update__:

On the [HN thread](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5143520) eridius suggested that I file a bug report with Apple. And so, I have. Now for a response....

[^1]: But, why support iOS 6 on the iPhone 3GS and not on the iPod Touch 3G? The iPod Touch came out after the iPhone - its more recent.
